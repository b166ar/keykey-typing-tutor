# KeyKey Privacy Policy

**Effective date:** 11 Jan 2024

At KeyKey Team, we respect your privacy and believe that the less we know about you, the better it is for both you and us. In fact, we do **not** collect any personal data through KeyKey unless you voluntarily provide it to us (e.g., by sending a support email or subscribing to a newsletter). We limit the information we collect to the minimum necessary to provide you with our service and improve KeyKey. Our business is developing and selling software, **not** collecting your personal data.

Below, we’ve provided detailed information on when and why we collect your personal data and how we use it. Please read this Privacy Policy carefully before providing any personal data to us.

## Owner and Operator of KeyKey

The desktop applications **KeyKey for macOS** (collectively, “KeyKey”) and the related website <https://KeyKey.ninja> (the “Website”) are owned and operated by **Sergiy Vynnychenko** (“we”, “us”, and “our”), registered in Kyiv, Ukraine.

When we ask you to provide us with your personal data, or if you contact us, we act as a **data controller** with regard to your personal data. It means that we are responsible for deciding what personal data can be collected from you and how it can be used.

## Data Storage

KeyKey stores your data (favourites list, ignored items, search index, etc.) in binary and human-readable formats **locally on your Mac device**.

This data is **not** transferred to or stored on our servers, nor do we have access to, own, or use this data in any other manner.

KeyKey also stores your current subscription information in your **iCloud storage** to allow you to use it on all your devices.

## Usage Analytics

We collect information about the way you use KeyKey. This information is **anonymised** and cannot be used to personally identify you. We’re only interested in knowing how many users use KeyKey, which features are used more often, and what we can do better.

All data are collected and provided to us by **Apple**. Please refer to Apple’s [privacy policies](https://www.apple.com/legal/privacy/) to understand how they process your personal data.

KeyKey keeps your current subscription details stored in your iCloud storage, enabling you to access them across all your devices.

## Payments

When you make payments related to KeyKey, you submit your payment details to **Apple** or **Setapp**. We do **not** collect your payment data and do **not** have any access to it. Please refer to the privacy policies of Apple and Setapp to check how they process your payment data.

## Cookies

We **do not use any cookies** on the Website or KeyKey.

## Support Interactions

When you contact us via a contact form on the Website, or by sending us an email, we collect your **email address, name, and any other information** you provide in your message voluntarily. This information is collected to help resolve your inquiry. If you would like to remove the emails you have sent, please let us know.

The legal basis on which we rely is **“pursuing our legitimate business interests”** (i.e., grow and maintain KeyKey and the Website) and **“your consent”** (for optional personal data that you voluntarily provide).

We use **email**.

## Marketing Messages

If you subscribe to our newsletter, provide opt-in consent to receive commercial communication, or conclude a service contract with us, we may—occasionally—send you messages about new KeyKey features or special offers. You can **opt-out** at any time by clicking the “unsubscribe” link in any marketing message.

You may also receive important technical notices and administrative emails. Such communication is **not** considered commercial, and opting out is **not** possible.

We use **SendGrid** for transactional emails and newsletters.

## What If You Refuse to Provide Personal Data?

If you decide not to provide personal data when requested, we may be unable to perform the requested operation (e.g., replying to you).

## Disclosure of Your Personal Data to Third Parties

We employ industry-appropriate organisational and technical measures to protect personal data from loss, misuse, unauthorised access, and disclosure—secured networks, strong passwords, limited team access, and data anonymisation (when possible).

## Managing Your Data

You may exercise the following rights (unless applicable law provides otherwise):

- **Right of access** – obtain a copy of the personal data we store about you and the purposes for which it is processed.  
- **Right to rectification** – correct inaccurate personal data we hold about you.  
- **Right to erasure (“right to be forgotten”)** – request deletion of your personal data from our systems.  
- **Right to restriction** – request that we restrict processing of your personal data.  
- **Right to data portability** – receive your personal data in a structured, machine-readable format and transmit it to another processor.  
- **Right to object** – object to our processing of your personal data.  
- **Right to withdraw consent** – withdraw consent you have previously given.  
- **Right to complaint** – lodge a complaint regarding our processing of your personal data.

To exercise any of these rights, email **support@keykey.ninja** with details. To verify legitimacy, we may request identifying information. We will respond within a reasonable timeframe, **no later than 30 days**.

If you remain dissatisfied, you may lodge a complaint with your local data protection authority. We do **not** discriminate against you for exercising your rights.

## Storage Period

We store personal data only as long as needed for its purposes, or until you request deletion. Once no longer necessary and absent legal justification to retain it, your personal data is securely deleted.

Non-personal data may be retained as long as necessary for the purposes described in this Policy, including for legitimate business interests. In certain legally mandated cases (e.g., archival of business records), we must store personal data for a limited time before deletion.
